Venturesity-Grabhouse CoDesign [October 31, 2015 - November 1, 2015]
======

OpenHouse presents the problem of visiting multiple locations in a short span of time and then deciding which house would be ideal for renting/buying. The solution tries to solve this problem by using a group of people for house hunting and handles group communication in real time for distributing the load among all house seekers. The solution also has a bidding system which enables the house owner to get the best price for the property.
